## Introduction
In this project the aim is to generate person specific data for the Irish population utilising variables specific to the Irish population in terms of the statistical distribution of the average adult age. The average mean height and weight for both a make and female adult in Ireland. The generated data can then be used to calculate the BMI index of the generated person data and graphed to show it visually.
