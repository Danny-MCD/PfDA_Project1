# PfDA_Project1 - Programming for Data Analysis Project
PfDA_Project1 - Generation of Data - Irish Nationals

## Introduction
In this project the aim is to generate a list people, with attributes specific for the Irish population. Utilising variables based on researched stastical facts about the Irish population. Then improving the accuracy of the generated data by generating it using a statistical distribution that most closely resembles the real life distribution of those attributes in the population. Finally to show the generated list of data in visual plots for further analysis. 

## Variables
The variables used in this project will be based on four attributes we can use to describe an average person. Those being their gender, age, height and weight.

## Distributions and Choice
The generated data uses normal distributions curves to accurately randomly choose the data based on known statiscal facts about the real life data. Facts taken from Irish Census data was used to determine the gender ratio in the Irish population and age distibution of it. Wikipedia pages detailing mean average height of nations and their Body Mass Index (BMI) were used to generate data based on normal distributions curves also.

## How to Run this project
This project is written in Python and uses Jupyter Notebooks to display it. It can be run using a python interpreter but for best presentation of it. It should be opened with Juypter Notebooks.
